We grow plenty of peas and I needed to cook something from them. Most of the Hungarian food recepies I know contains milk, but I wanted to avoid that. Finally I found one that souneded interesting and I wanted to try it.

Portion: 4 protion stew, 2 prtoion meetball

Veggie Stew:
  *  200g pea
  *  Half zucchini
  *  2 small white carrot
  *  3 medium tomatoes
  *  2 heads of onion
  *  3 cloves of garlic
  *  2 bay leafs
  *  1 table spoon flour
  *  salt, pepper, sugar

Ingredients for meatballs:
  * 250g grounded meat
  * 1 small silce of dry bread
  * 1 egg
  * 1 cloves of garlic
  * paprika powder
  * majoranna
  * salt, pepper
  * bread crumbs

Steps of the stew:
  *  Finely chopped the onion and put them to the preheated pan. Keep it on a low temperature
  *  Add the bay leaf, garlic, finely chopped carrots, zucchini and mix it. Keep it about 10 minutes.
  *  Add the chopped tomatoes and boil it
  *  When the ingredients melted into the dish, add the flour and mix it well
  *  finally add the fresh peas and the meal is ready in couple of minutes

Steps of the meatballs:
  *  Put the bread into water and than squeeze out the liquid well
  *  Chop the garlic
  *  Mix all of the ingredients (except bread crumbs) well and put it in the fridge at least for an hour
  *  Make about 10 meatballs and rotate them in the bread crumbs 
  *  Heat the oil for medium and fry the balls slowly

Conclusion:
  *  Stew was fine
  *  Meatball texture was fine, but the taste was not characteristic. If I have more time I would roast the garlic with some onion and paprika powder can be replaced with smoaked paprika powder
  *  Frozen meat has always a taste. It should be used only in emergency
