This is the most well-known Hungarian meal, foreign people call it gulas, but we call it pörkölt. It can be made from any kind of meat (chicken, deer, beef ... etc), but the most popular is made of pork.

Ingredients:
  *  90 dkg pork meat (picnic ham and/or leg)
  *  2 hungarian peppers
  *  2 tomatoes
  *  3-4 head of onions
  *  2-3 spoon home made paprika cream
  *  2-3 dl good red wine
  *  gulas spice cube
  *  oil
  *  Sour cream
  *  Spices: salt, pepper, paprika,
  *  Potato for side dish

Steps of the recipe:
  *  Chop the veggies up into small pieces and the meat into cubes
  *  Heat up some oil to medium and start to fry the onion
  *  Add the pepper and tomato and fry about 5-10 minutes
  *  Add spices, wine, paprika cream and spice cube, mix it well
  *  Boil it a bit and then add the meat
  *  Add so much water to cover the meat.
  *  Boil it about an hour in low heat
  *  When the meat melts in your mouth, get some stew into a bowl, mix it with the sour cream and add to the stew
  *  Serve it with boiled potato and more sour cream

Conclusion:
  *  I would not serve it again with boiled potato, pasta or dumpling fits better with the stew. Potato has a too characteristic taste.
  *  Using broth instead of artificial spice cube and water.
  *  That was my first time when I added red wine to the pörökölt, but I really like it. It fits pretty well.
  *  Pork fat instead of oil, it would make the meal more flavoury.
  *  Add the meat earlier and fry it before cooking.
  *  Add some hot paprika besides the sweet one.
