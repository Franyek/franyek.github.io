After huge, heavy Christmas meals which is based on western diet (full of fatty meats and milk products), I wanted to care my body with some vegan food. Therefore I started researching how to make an indian Dhal and I watched a couple of Youtube videos, here is the list:

The cooks of the meals use plenty of different species, but the mixture of the species are always different. As far as I see there is no 2 same Dhal. You can use any combinations, but 2 things is fixed. Lentils and strong indian spice mixture. So here is my simple interpretation:
 *  Grab some indian specie mixture
 *  Heat some oil to low temperature and roast the dried spices a bit
 *  Put the non-dried-spices (ginger, garlic, chili, onion ... etc.) and turn a bit up the heat
 *  After couple of minute roasting, add the veggies and roast them too
 *  Add the red lentils and double amount of water
 *  Taste it and add some salt, pepper and any other spice that you are missing
 *  When the lentils are soft, add a bit of coconut milk (It can work without coconut milk, bit I like when the strong species and soft milk meet), and you are done

That is my ultimate Dhal recipe. Here is the species that I used:
 *  Garam Masala (one big table spoon)
 *  Little bit kurkuma
 *  One bay leaf (after first round of roasting I took that out)
 *  Bit of chili powder
 *  Salt, pepper
 *  Garlic, ginger
