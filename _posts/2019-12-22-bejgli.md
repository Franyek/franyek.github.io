This is a traditional Hungarian christmas cake, that is usually made of poppy seed or walnut, but nowadays other type of stuffings are getting popular like chestnut.

Portion: 2 rod of Bejgli, one from poppy seed, one from walnut

Ingredients for dough:
  *  5 dkg icing sugar
  *  0,5 kg flour
  *  0,5 tea spoon salt
  *  20 dkg butter
  *  1 egg yolk
  *  1,25 dl milk
  *  1 dkg yeast

Ingredients for stuffings:
  * 3-4 dl water
  * 60 dkg sugar
  * 1-1 tea spoon cinnamon
  * 1-1 small package vanilin sugar
  * 1-1 peel of lemon
  * 0,25 - 0,25 dkg minced poppy seed, walnut
  * 5-6 pieces of clove
  * 10 dkg raisin

Steps of the recipe:
  *  Mix the dry ingredients of the dough (sugar, flour, salt)
  *  Gradually crush the butter into it 
  *  Mix the wet ingredients (egg yolk, milk, yeast) and add this mixture to the dough
  *  Knead it until it became homogeneous
  *  Cut it into half, wrap them and put them into the fridge at least for an hour  
  *  Make a sugar syrup: add the sugar and the cloves to the boiling water and boil it for 6-7 minutes
  *  Mix the stuffings dry ingredients: cinnamon, vanilin sugar, lemon peel, walnut/poppy seed, raisin to the walnut stuffing
  *  Add gradually the syrup to the sutffings, it gets perfect, when you can make small balls from the sutffing 
  *  Let the stuffings cool down
  *  Stretch the dough into a rectangle, it supposed to be 3-4 mm thin
  *  Put the stuffing into the dough: keep the edges free from the stuffing, stuffing should one finger thick
  *  Fold the side of the dough to the stuffing
  *  Round up the dough
  *  Daub the dough: daub with egg yolk, 20 min in fridge, egg yolk, 20 min fridge, egg-white, 30 min in a warm temperature spot for example next to a radiator
  *  Make little holes on the cake, then the steam will come out and the dough wont be opened
  *  Put it into a preheated (200C) oven for 20-30 mins

Conclusion:
  *  200 degree is too much, cake was a bit raw in the middle, about 180 degree should be fine
  *  Poppy seed was too sweet. Walnut needed less syrup, because it is more oily and raisins was also wet, it required less syrup. Other ingredients needs to be added to the poppy seed stuffing to became less sweet and more tasty, for example plum jam or apple or orange/lemon juice 
  *  Poppy seed bejgli got opened, because the stuffing was too wet
