When I lived in Germany there were months when we ate thai curry at least once in a week. Then I fall in love with that food. Now I am back in Hungary and I haven't found a good thai place yet, but I am missing it, so today I tried to reproduce it.

I used this video for inspiration: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIbKVpBQKJI&t=22s>

I didn't follow exactly the recipe because I didnt have every ingredients, but I think I got really close to the taste that I am missing.

Ingredients:
  *  Yellow curry paste 2-3 tea spoon 
  *  Garlic 3 cloves, chopped
  *  Ginger 1 thumb, chopped
  *  One normal Chicken breast
  *  3-4 small carrot
  *  2 onion
  *  3 dl coconut milk
  *  one big spoon of veggie soup
  *  one small spoon of sugar

Steps of the recipe:
  *  Heat up the oil
  *  Fry the paste, garlic, ginger a bit
  *  Add the chopped onion and continue the fry
  *  Add the chopped chicken and fry it till the chicken gets white
  *  Add the coconut milk, the veggie soup and the carrot
  *  Taste it and season it with salt, pepper, sugar or you can add more chili
  *  Boil it till the carrot gets soft
  *  Serve it in bowls with rice

Conclusion:
  *  Before the last seasoning it was a bit spicy for me and I needed to use a bit sugar: less paste or without any paste, get thai spices and make your own spice mixture
  *  Too much meat: half chicken breast would be enough and MORE veggie, in winter eg. squash, parsnips, celeriac. Use them even if you dont like them because taste of the sauce is stronger then the veggies's.
