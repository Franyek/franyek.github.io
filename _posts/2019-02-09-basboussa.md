One of my Syrian friend baked us Basboussa in my German course and that was so tasty, that I asked for the recipe. I haven't tried it yet, but I found my handwritten recipe and I want to save it for myself. We used to have some communication problem (we didnt have a common language), so the recipe isn't completly ready, I will need to do some further research.  


Ingredients:
  *  One portion cream
  *  0,5 liter milk
  *  3 spoons of corn flour
  *  1 small spoon of orange blossom water 
  *  1 cup of plain yogurt 
  *  cup of oil
  *  cup of sugar
  *  1 egg
  *  tasse Greiss ??????
  *  Coconut
  *  Vanilla
  *  Baking powder
