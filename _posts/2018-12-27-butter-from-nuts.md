This is not my first try. I made my first almond butter 2 years ago, in 2016. Then I tried different variatons. From barely-dried-madel, normally-dried-madel and pealed, toasted almond. Pealed was preatty, good, but took too much effort, so I would say the mid-toasted, unpealed almond was the best. Here is how I made:
 *  Get dried almond/peanut... anything
 *  Preheat the oven to 200 CÂ°
 *  Put the nuts to the oven to about 10 minutes, but at 5 minutes, open the oven, let the vapor goes out form the oven, because we need dried, toasted nuts, and stir the nuts a bit.
 *  After toasting let the nuts cool down
 *  Get a strong chopper. I tried to make butter with a 230W strong chopper, but it is was very hard, so I would recommend to use a stronger one.
 *  Chop the nuts on the highest level until it became creamy. Be patient it takes at least 5 minutes, but worth it!
 
 
**ATTENTION**

Reduce the water of the nuts as much as you can and dont add any kind of liquids, otherwise it will go wrong in less than a week.
